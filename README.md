## Summary

Employee Tracker is a CLI application for building a company's employee database, as well as maintaining personalized information about their workers. 

This app allows employers to track their employees, departments, roles within the company, as well as a quick glance at each department's budget. There is also a deletion tool built into the app to allow employers to quickly adjust their roster.
